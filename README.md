**Minimum Node Version: 16.5 or higher**

Get started:

- create your own repo (for example on www.github.com)
- change the origin to your own repo with `git remote set-url origin <remote_url>`
- run `npm i` to install all dependencies
- change directory to whatever tech suites you best
- run `npm run migrate` (1 migration should throw an exception)
- run `npm run test` (1 test should succeed and 3 should fail due to exceptions)

Your task:

- Read the exceptions in console and go to the files where exceptions are thrown.
- In these files, you will find what you need to do to pass the test cases.

Good luck! 🍀🚀
